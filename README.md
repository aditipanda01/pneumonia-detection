Pneumonia Detection Using AI
Pneumonia is a life-threatening respiratory condition, and early detection is vital for effective treatment. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop an automated system for diagnosing pneumonia using chest X-ray images.

Features
Dataset: Utilizes labeled chest X-ray images (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s Chest X-ray dataset).
Deep Learning Model: Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Technology Stack: Built using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates the model's effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Real-World Impact: Assists in reducing diagnostic time and supports healthcare professionals in decision-making.

Objectives
Automate pneumonia detection with high accuracy.
Minimize diagnostic errors and inconsistencies.
Enable deployment in resource-limited areas to improve healthcare accessibility.
